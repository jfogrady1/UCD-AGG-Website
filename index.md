# Welcome to the University College Dublin Animal Genomics Group!

The UCD Animal Genomics Group (UCD-AGG) is a team of researchers principally affiliated with the [UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science](https://www.ucd.ie/agfood/) and working closely with colleagues at the [UCD School of Veterinary Medicine]() dedicated to answering important questions in livestock genomics with computational techniques.
We primarily focus on integrating different omics layers, leveraging novel computational and statistical methodologies, and harnessing high-resolutiom genomic datasets to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits in livestock

We are a team of dedicated bioinformaticians and animal genomics researchers committed to advancing the frontiers of livestock genomics. By leveraging state-of-the art population, functional, and integrative genomic techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture underpinning economically important production traits. We foster an open and inclusive research environment, and recognise that diversity is a key pillar undergirding innovation and discovery.
