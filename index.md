title: Empowering livestock through genomics

# Welcome to the University College Dublin Animal Genomics Group!

The UCD Animal Genomics Group (UCD-AGG) is a team of researchers principally affiliated with the [UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science](https://www.ucd.ie/agfood/) and working closely with colleagues at the [UCD School of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.ucd.ie/vetmed/) dedicated to answering important questions in livestock genomics with computational techniques.
We primarily focus on integrating different omics layers, leveraging novel computational and statistical methodologies, and harnessing high-resolutiom genomic datasets to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits in livestock

## Our Focus

Population genomics explores the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of cattle through high-density SNP-array and whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. Analyses of admixture reveal complex ancestries, particularly between taurine and indicine lineages shaped by domestication and crossbreeding. Evolutionary models trace demographic changes and adaptation across environments. Selection signature methods—such as FST, CSS, and GWAS—identify genomic regions linked to traits like heat tolerance, disease resistance, and productivity. Together, these approaches uncover the genetic basis of adaptation and inform sustainable breeding, conservation, and livestock improvement strategies.

Integrative genomics combines diverse omics data types such as genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics to uncover host-pathogen interactions in tuberculosis. By integrating these layers, we aim to identify regulatory variants and pathways that influence TB susceptibility and immune response in both humans and cattle _in vivo_ and _in vitro_. This systems-level approach enhances understanding of disease mechanisms, highlights shared and species-specific host responses, and guides the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and genetic selection strategies for improved resistance.

We are a team of dedicated bioinformaticians and animal genomics researchers committed to advancing the frontiers of livestock genomics. By leveraging state-of-the art population, functional, and integrative genomic techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture underpinning economically important production traits. We foster an open and inclusive research environment, and recognise that diversity is a key pillar undergirding innovation and discovery.
