title: Empowering livestock through genomics

# Welcome to the University College Dublin Animal Genomics Group!

The UCD Animal Genomics Group (UCD-AGG) is a team of researchers principally affiliated with the [UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science](https://www.ucd.ie/agfood/) and working closely with colleagues at the [UCD School of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.ucd.ie/vetmed/) dedicated to answering important questions in livestock genomics with computational techniques.
We primarily focus on integrating different omics layers, leveraging novel computational and statistical methodologies, and harnessing high-resolutiom genomic datasets to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex traits in livestock

## Our Focus

{% capture text %}

Population genomics explores the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of cattle through high-density SNP-array and whole-genome sequence data. Analyses of admixture reveal complex ancestries, particularly between taurine and indicine lineages shaped by domestication and crossbreeding. Evolutionary models trace demographic changes and adaptation across environments. Selection signature methods—such as F_ST, CSS, and GWAS—identify genomic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) linked to traits like heat tolerance, disease resistance, and productivity. Together, these approaches uncover the genetic basis of adaptation and inform sustainable breeding, conservation, and livestock improvement strategies.

We are a team of dedicated bioinformaticians and animal genomics researchers committed to advancing the frontiers of livestock genomics. By leveraging state-of-the art population, functional, and integrative genomic techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the genetic architecture underpinning economically important production traits. We foster an open and inclusive research environment, and recognise that diversity is a key pillar undergirding innovation and discovery.
