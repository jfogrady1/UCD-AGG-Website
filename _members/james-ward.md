I earned a B.Sc. degree in Genetics and Cell Biology from Dublin City University in 2019. Currently, I am working in Prof. David MacHughâ€™s lab at University College Dublin. My primary focus is on the population and functional genomics of both modern and ancient cattle, with a special emphasis on breeds originating from South America and Africa.
